# stock-analysis
Purpose of the Analysis.
  The purpose of this analysis is to refactor or edit a Microsoft VBA code to collect information for both stock performances 2017 and 2018 and loop through all the data to determine whether the stocks are worth investing or not. Another purpose of this analysis is to see if the refactored code runs faster than the original code.
 Advantages of Refactoring the Code.
  a) Makes the code neat and well-organized; b) More straightforward and easy to understand; c) Makes running the code easier and faster; d) Easier to loop through data as quick as possible.
  Disadvantages of Refactoring the Code.
  a) Can affect the final outcomes after running the code; b) applications without the proper codes can affect the refactored code.
  Pros and Cons to Refactoring the original VBA Script.
  A huge pro of the refactored VBA script is that it is can be easily read, well-organized, changed easily and understood quickly. Another pro is that the refactored code can be run on the stocks. Due to the refactored VBA Script we have different macro run times for both stock performances (2017 and 2018) when compared to the original VBA Script.
  Attached below are the screenshots of the macro run times using the original VBA Script.
